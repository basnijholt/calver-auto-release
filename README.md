## Usage

### GitHub Action

Add this to your workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/release.yml`):

```yaml
name: Create Release
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Create release with CalVer
      - uses: basnijholt/calver-auto-release@v1
        id: release
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # Optional: custom configuration
          skip_patterns: "[skip release],[no-release]"
          footer: "Custom footer text"

      # Optional: publish to PyPI
      # Only run if a new version was created
      - name: Build package
        if: steps.release.outputs.version != ''
        run: |
          python -m pip install build
          python -m build

      # Option 1: Publish with official PyPA action
      - name: Publish package distributions to PyPI
        if: steps.release.outputs.version != ''
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1

      # Option 2: Publish with twine
      # - name: Publish package distributions to PyPI
      #   if: steps.release.outputs.version != ''
      #   env:
      #     TWINE_USERNAME: __token__
      #     TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
      #   run: |
      #     python -m pip install twine
      #     twine upload dist/*
```

The action creates a new release with CalVer versioning, and you can optionally add your preferred method for publishing to PyPI or any other post-release tasks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` variable is automatically populated (see [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication)).
> However, releases created using `GITHUB_TOKEN` will not trigger other workflows that run on the `release` event.
> If you need to trigger other workflows when a release is created, you'll need to:
> 1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `contents: write` permissions at https://github.com/settings/tokens
> 2. Add it to your repository secrets (e.g., as `PAT`)
> 3. Use it in the workflow:
>    ```yaml
>    - uses: basnijholt/calver-auto-release@v1
>      with:
>        github_token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}  # Instead of secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN
>    ```

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Basic usage
calver-auto-release --repo-path /path/to/repo

# Dry run (show what would happen without creating the release)
calver-auto-release --repo-path /path/to/repo --dry-run

# Custom skip patterns
calver-auto-release --repo-path /path/to/repo --skip-pattern "[no-release]" --skip-pattern "[skip]"
```

### Python API
```python
from calver_auto_release import create_release

# Basic usage
create_release()  # Uses current directory

# With custom configuration
create_release(
    repo_path="/path/to/repo",
    skip_patterns=["[skip]", "[no-release]"],
    footer="\nCustom footer text",
    dry_run=True,  # Show what would happen without creating the release
)
```

### Release Notes Format
The generated release notes will have this format:
```
üöÄ Release YYYY.MM.PATCH

üìù This release includes the following changes:

- First commit message
- Second commit message
- etc.

üôè Thank you for using this project! Please report any issues or feedback on the GitHub repository
```

### Requirements
- Git repository with an 'origin' remote configured
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git command-line tools installed

## Installation

Install using pip:
```bash
pip install calver-auto-release
```

Or using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):
```bash
uv pip install calver-auto-release
```

## Configuration

### Skip Release Patterns

You can skip creating a release by including these patterns in your commit message:
- `[skip release]`
- `[pre-commit.ci]`
- `‚¨ÜÔ∏è Update`

### Version Format

The version format follows CalVer: `YYYY.MM.PATCH`
- `YYYY`: Current year
- `MM`: Current month
- `PATCH`: Incremental number, resets when year or month changes

### Custom Footer

You can customize the footer text that appears at the end of each release note:

```python
create_release(
    footer="\nCustom footer text for all releases"
)
```

Or via CLI:
```bash
calver-auto-release --footer "Custom footer text"
```

Or in the GitHub Action:
```yaml
- uses: basnijholt/calver-auto-release@v1
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    footer: "Custom footer text"
```
